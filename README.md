# Volunteer Coordination Platform

## 🌍 Project Overview

**A Web-based Platform for Volunteer Coordination in Kenya**

This comprehensive web-based platform addresses the critical disconnect between organizations seeking volunteer support and individuals eager to contribute their time and skills to meaningful causes. By creating a centralized digital ecosystem, the platform streamlines volunteer recruitment, management, and coordination processes while fostering stronger community engagement across Kenya.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The volunteering sector faces significant challenges with inefficient volunteer-opportunity matching, resulting in:
- **44% decline** in global volunteer workforce (2018-2021)
- Underutilization of volunteer skills and expertise
- Poor communication channels between organizations and volunteers
- Lack of centralized platforms for effective volunteer coordination
- Reduced motivation and retention among volunteers
